  desc1:
    " Dry eye disease is a multi-factorial disease and is generally a product of one of two reasons: the tears are evaporating too quickly or the eye is not producing enough tears (evaporative vs aqueous deficient). Both of these cause damage to the ocular surface and are associated with symptoms of discomfort and visual disturbance.",
  desc2:
    "In our current day and age the number of people suffering from Dry Eye Syndrome has dramatically increased, especially in the last 10 years. Until recently, it was believed that dry eyes were caused by decreased production of tears, so artificial tears were prescribed to supplement and decrease symptoms of dryness. However, research and clinical evidence shows that artificial tears only provide immediate relief. It is now thought that the main cause of dry eye is due to poor tear film quality rather than decreased production of the tears.",
  desc3:
    "Dry eye syndrome is commonly caused by Meibomian gland dysfunction, demodex, ocular allergies, lid interaction, or systemic disease such as Sjogren's syndrome. Also, environmental conditions such as working on a computer, in dusty environments, or sleeping with a ceiling fan on can also cause symptoms.",

  causesDesc: [
    "At Alamo Eye Care, we specialize in a variety of contact lenses. Many patients have a necessity for contact lenses which can sometimes lead to dry eye if there is a tear film insufficiency. We encourage patients to use artificial tears to keep their tear film at a stable amount to maintain contact lens wear. If you use artificial tears a lot, read the next section on artifical tear recommendations. ",
    "Patients use eyedrops often for many reasons. Glaucoma drops are known to have a larger amount of preservatives and those who use them daily or more can be susceptible to dry eye. Some over-the-counter eyedrops contain preservatives like BAK which can irritate the cornea further if used in excess. If you use glaucoma drops and have dry eye, consider asking your glaucoma specialist about preservative free options. If you use artificial tears often, also consider preservative free options. The OTC brands and products we recommend are Systane PF, Refresh PF, BioTrue Hydration Plus PF, and Ivizia. ",
    "Many patients, especially here in South Texas, battle seasonal allergies. These allergens float through the air and can find their way into the eye. Animal dander is another culprit than can cause ocular allergies. Most ocular allergy flare ups can be minimized with the use of Pataday (over-the-counter olopatadine) and artificial tears like the ones listed above. For more severe cases, we recommended making an appointment to be treated with corticosteroids or for further investigation. Remember that anti-histamines can also exacerbate dryness and should be used as directed or as needed. ",
    "As cosmetics become a day to day routine for many people, the application of makeup on the eyelid and waterline can introduce bacteria to the eye. Many patients have noted seeing powders in their tear film which can dry out the eye. Minimizing the use of makeup around the eye can reduce dry eye symptoms. Tubular mascara is a new addition to the cosmetic scene that is minimizing the amount of bacteria entering the eye via mascara. There are some cosmetic brands that are approved for use with contact lenses due to the integrity of their ingredients. We recommend Clinique, Neutrogena, and Physician Formula. ",

  desc2:
    "The meibomian glands are located in the upper and lower eyelids and drain their oils onto the surface of the eye. The oil from the glands create the oily layer of the tear film which is combined with mucins and tears. When the oils are clogged in the glands or cannot be expressed easily, the natural tears do not have an anchor, and evaporate more quickly. See below for an example of clogged meibomian glands",
  desc3:
    "When you have MGD, it is important to start at-home and/or in-office therapy. Therapy will decrease ocular surface inflammation and dry eye symptoms, as well as set your eyes up for a healthy future to avoid the risk for possible dry eye disease in the future. ",
