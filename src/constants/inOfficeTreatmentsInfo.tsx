    title: "Autologous Serum Tears",
    desc: "When artificial lubricating tears aren't enough for the severity of the disease, tears can be prescribed that are made from your own blood. After your blood is drawn, the platelets and clotting factors are removed. Then, the blood serum is combined with sterile saline to provide a unique eyedrop that has many of the same growth factors and nutrients that normal tears provide. ",

  {
    title: "Scleral Lenses",
    desc: "In moderate to severe cases of dry eye, scleral contact lenses can be used to keep the eye hydrated all day. These specialty contact lenses are different from conventional soft lenses because they are formulated to vault over the cornea and rest on the sclera, or the white part of the eye. This vault creates a fluid-filled bowl that holds fluid on the eye to relieve dry eye symptoms throughout the day.",
